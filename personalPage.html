    <h1>Welcome to my life!</h1>

    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I am an adventurous person who <b>loves to travel</b> , read books, get together with groups of people and explore new places in Sofia. I like to make changes both in my appearance and in my personal life. When I set a clear goal, I make quick decisions about how to get there as soon as possible while talking to myself <i>You can achieve anything you want!</i></p>
    <p>I have been working at <em>"Coca Cola Hellenic"</em> since 2018, chaged two positions and deprtments. My curret possition is a Cross-Border palanner where my main task is to precisely plan the import and export volumes of all goods Hellenic is buying from or selling to other countries.</p>

    <h3>Edcation</h3>
    <p>I graduated with a bachelor's degree in <b>Technical University in Sofia</b>  with a degree in public administration. I also have a master's degree in information security.</p>
    
    <h3>Pets</h3>
    <p>I wake up in the morning and in the evening I fall asleep side by side with my lovely Dalmatian - <b>Newton, "The Innocent"</b> . His wet nose is the first thing I see in the morning after I open my eyes and I love it! Тhe second part of his name comes from the pope who gives the title of king Кaloyan in year 1204.</p>

    <h3>Hobbies and quality time for me</h3>
    <p>Besides, I like to travel and read, I love to ski in the winter and go for group workouts or long walks with Newton all year round. I generally like to be physically active and always spend part of my day playing sports.</p>
    <p>I show a complete interest in design (in all its forms), I completed a basic course in <em>graphic design</em>  and a complete course in <em>interior design</em> . In my free time I like to look at completed projects of prominent designers and architects and to create mood boards after getting inspired.</p>

    <h2>What do I expect from the Front-end course?</h2>
    <p>I expect to expand my knowledge of design. I want to learn confidently and independently <mark> how to build properly structured web pages</mark> and turn this interest into a career.</p>
